# company a vs company b

The list below isn't by priority but it is the thought process I go through.

1. Compensation - Would you be comfortable with that salary and can you do the things you want to do with it (vacation, hobbies, etc.).

2. Interest - Is the work that you will be doing at the company engaging to you? Are you interested in solving those problems? Would I be excited going into the office every day?

3. People - While interviewing, did you enjoy the conversations you had with your potential coworkers? Do you think similarly but do you also challenge each other to be better versions of yourself?

4. Size - Small companies don't have process and you'll have to wear many different hats. Large companies have more defined roles and your focus will be better planned by higher ups who set an overall strategy.

5. Location - The best way I thought of this is the commute. Count the minutes (hours) it takes to get to your new company. Will you be "time poor" but "financially wealthy"? Would you be okay with that?

6. Risk - Smaller companies naturally have more risk. I personally think we tend to over index on the risk (Prospect Theory) and forget about the lessons and professional development you learn at a start up.

7. Regret - This one helped me out the most. I ask myself "Would I regret not working at this company with its people and product X years from now?"

8. Growth - What are the trends in that industry? Has the company expanded or contracted recently? Do potential coworkers have a growth mindset?

9. Remote - Were they remote from day #1? Is the _entire_ company on-board and structured for it? What is the timezone coverage and do you have someone else to pair with that's also in your timezone (ie company hires in pairs)
